        - Input: You never cared about my feelings, you're just selfish.
        - Expected Output: I feel like my emotions were never a priority to you, it seems like you only think about yourself.
        
        - Input: You never seem to care about how I feel. It's like talking to a brick wall.
        - Expected Output: I feel like my emotions are not being acknowledged when we talk. It's frustrating when it seems like my feelings are not being heard or understood.
        
        - Input: You always try to control my life and make me feel like a failure. You don't care about my well-being, only your own.
        - Expected Output: I feel like you often try to dictate what I do and it makes me feel inadequate. It seems like you prioritize your needs over mine and don't consider my well-being.
        
        - Input: Why can't you ever just be there for me when I need emotional support? Instead, you always neglect my feelings.
        - Expected Output: I really need you to listen and support me emotionally when I'm going through a tough time. It would mean a lot to me if you could be there for me and acknowledge my feelings.
        
        - Input: I can't believe how self-centered and narrow-minded you are, always thinking about yourself and not what we need as a couple.
        - Expected Output: It's important for us to consider each other's needs as a couple. Let's work on being more understanding and supportive of each other.
