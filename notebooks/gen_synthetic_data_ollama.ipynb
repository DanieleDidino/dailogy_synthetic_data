      "1. Criticism: This involves making global, negative statements about a partner instead of focusing on specific actions or behaviors. For example, saying \"You're always late\" instead of \"I feel frustrated when you don't show up on time.\"\n",
      "2. Defensiveness: Partners may become defensive in response to criticism and blame their partners for the issue at hand. This can lead to a cycle of defensiveness and counter-defensiveness, making it difficult to address the root cause of conflict.\n",
      "3. Contempt: Contempt refers to a deep sense of disgust or disdain towards a partner. It often manifests through sarcasm, mockery, or hostile humor, which can erode trust and respect in the relationship.\n",
      "4. Stonewalling: Stonewalling occurs when one partner withdraws emotionally from the conflict by refusing to engage in conversation or displaying physical distance. This behavior can lead to a breakdown in communication and make it difficult for partners to resolve issues together.\n",
